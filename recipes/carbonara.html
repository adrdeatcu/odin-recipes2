        <h2 class="secondh">Description</h2>
        <p>This is a real <em>spaghetti carbonara</em> recipe made the traditional Italian way, without a single drop of cream. It relies solely on egg and cheese to make a luscious, creamy carbonara sauce. Food fit for a king (or queen!) that proves simple can be magnificent.</p>
        <p><strong>Economical note -</strong> Use bacon instead of guanciale and parmesan instead of parmigiano reggiano for a very respectable version of carbonara that will still make Italians proud. But don't add cream!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul class="recipe-ul">
                <li>Eggs</li>
                <li>Guanciale</li>
                <li>Spaghetti</li>
                <li>Parmigiano reggiano</li>
                <li>Pepper</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol class="recipe-ol">
                <li>Batons - Cut the guanciale into thick batons. Biting through the golden brown crust into meaty bits of salty guanciale is part of the awesomeness that is carbonara!</li>
                <li>Finely grate the parmigiana reggiano or pecorino.</li>
                <li>Sauce - Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling the eggs.</li>
                <li>Cook pasta - Bring 4 litres (4 quarts) of water to the boil with 1 tablespoon of salt. Cook the pasta per packet directions. It should be firm, not soft, but fully cooked through.</li>
                <li>Reserve pasta cooking water - Just before draining, scoop out one cup of pasta cooking water. Then drain the pasta in a colander.</li>
                <li>Cook guanciale until golden while the pasta is cooking. You donâ€™t need any oil, the guanciale will fry in its own fat.</li>
                <li>Toss pasta in guanciale - Tumble the hot pasta into the pan with the guanciale then toss so the pasta gets coated in the guanciale fat.</li>
                <li>Transfer into sauce bowl -Tip the hot pasta into the bowl with the egg and use a rubber spatula to scrape out every drop of the guanciale fat into the bowl. That stuff is gold!</li>
                <li>Add 1/2 cup pasta cooking water into the bowl.</li>
                <li>Mix vigorously with the handle of a wooden spoon, spinning the pasta around, for around 30 seconds to 1 minute. Watch as the watery pale yellow liquid magically transforms into a creamy sauce.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately in warm bowls. Pasta waits for no one!</li>
